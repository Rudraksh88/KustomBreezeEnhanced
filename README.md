# Kustom Breeze Enhanced
A spiced-up remix of Sierra Breeze Enhanced‚Äînow with extra usability, fresh button styles, and a bit of tastefully applied chaos.

#### Tweaks
- **Clickable Corners & Edges ("Magic Corners")**
Fitts‚Äôs Law enjoyers, rejoice. The corners and edges are now hit targets, just like the Windows Start button or every theme that respects sanity. Breeze? Yes. BreezeEnhanced? Yes. SierraBreezeEnhanced had it‚Äîthen someone thought it was a bug and axed it. I'm putting it back where it belongs.

- Opacity based Titlebar text (Window title/caption) color.
Tailored for translucent themes: the window title now picks up just a hint of background color. It‚Äôs subtle, it‚Äôs slick, and it keeps the caption from looking like it‚Äôs floating in a void.

- Darker titlebar - `#121212`
To blend with my [Zephyr Kvantum](https://github.com/Rudraksh88/zephyr-kvantum) dark theme. Combined with a matched opacity drop (to offset Kvantum‚Äôs opacity values), it pulls off that clean, frameless aesthetic we all love.

#### New Button Styles
- **Plasma**
The classic, reimagined with flair. The buttons now glow to full opacity on hover. And for the 'Always on top' button, added a custom hollow/filled dot that looks right at home in the titlebar.

- **Mac Mono**
A monochrome version of the macOS Sierra theme. And they also are opacity-based so doesn't look out of place in a translucent theme. The 'Always on top' here is only visible on hover/active as mac themes look better with the traditional 3 button setup.

- **Zephyr**
My own original flavor. Originally lived in a personal fork of BreezeEnhanced called [Zephyr](https://github.com/Rudraksh88/zephyr). That got borked by `KDecoration3`, so I gave it a new home here. Now with all the new SBE goodness baked in.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
After installing, you‚Äôll need to restart KWin for the decoration to show up:

On Wayland: run `kwin_wayland --replace`

You can run that from KRunner (Alt+Space or Alt+F2), or just log out and back in like it's 2005. Once that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôll find Sierra Breeze Enhanced in:
